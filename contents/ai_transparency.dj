# AI Transparency Statement

All blog posts are written by me. I primarily use LLMs for editing (fixing grammar or to improve writing style) with [wiz](https://github.com/lauacosta/wiz). I also use it as my own talking duck (a stark improvement over my [usual one](https://cdn.lautaroacosta.com/ferris.avif)), to bounce ideas around and discuss concepts.

That is to say, the substance of my posts is my own thinking.
