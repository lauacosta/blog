## Style Guidelines

For all my typography-mindend readers, this is the guideline the site follows:

- [`Iosevka`](http://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka) for everything code related.
- [et-book](https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/) for everything else.
- Hyperlinks that redirect outside this site are [like this](https://github.com/lauacosta/).
- Hyperlinks that redirect to a page inside this site are [like this](/about.html).
- Point size is the web default 16px. 
- H1, H2 and H3 are 250%, 200% and 150% the point size, respectively.
- Line spacing is 200% the point size.
- The handling of sidenotes is the same as [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
