Hi! I am Lautaro Acosta Quintana, a programmer from Argentina. I'm currently pursuing an Information Systems Engineering degree at [UTN](https://utn.edu.ar/es/).

I write about things I find interesting and to convey my thoughts. Writing leaves very little room for vagueness, so I find it a great way to consolidate knowledge by chasing down all the holes in my understanding.

You can find me in different platforms using the links at the bottom.
